        <p>It's 2am & I just set this up. I guess i feel pretty okay so far.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Later in the day now. I didnt do much in terms of finding work but I got my groceries & found some burning passion for art again. This feels nice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="two">
        <p style ="color:#e70f50">3/03/2021</p>
        <p>I went to sleep last night feeling inspired, determined & motivated. I was genuinely excited to wake up. Now that Im here though, some of that good feeling has fallen away but Im still doing what I can to make myself feel productive. Hopefully I can have some small victories today.</p>

        <p>Reilly is making me a sketchbook to work in from scratch! Genuinely appreciate this guy so much & I cant wait to draw some contour illustrations from public spaces around Perth.<br>This is my way of making sure I will actually do that.</p>

        <p>Spoke to Jamie about us today. I let her know that I was okay with being friends after all this. Im glad it went smoothly. Ill see her soon & talk about moving on & meeting new people. Im really relieved that this went down well. </p>
