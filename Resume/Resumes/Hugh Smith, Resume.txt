Hello! My name is Hugh Smith & I am a young graphic designer/illustrator. If you're looking for a keen spirited & hard working up & comer then I'm the one you have been looking for! I recently graduated from a bachelor of the arts, Graphic Design course. I have been passionate about the arts since I was a young child & over my teenage years I developed a strong love for Design of many kinds. I decided to focus on Graphic Design & Ui/Ux Design however as I find that is where my strength lies. I am ready, motivated & available to commence work at a moment's notice. I am always down to learn new skills, software & workflows if needed. But I'm not just a designer, I have a passion for reading & learning as much as I can about our incredible world! On the side, I also enjoy collecting niche manga, caring for & collecting house plants in absence of an actual pet & indulging in life's simpler pleasures i.e. eating homemade bacon pancakes.

Adobe Software Proficiencies
I have full access to the Adobe creative suite & am more than willing to put in the time to learn new programs or refine my skills.


Photoshop: Highly Proficient
Photoshop is my strongest program. I am confident in my abilities to create illustrated graphics, photo-bashes, wireframes, digital paintings & photo manipulation. I am very comfortable with all the tools in this program & have been keeping myself updated with all updates & new abilities of the software.


Xd: New But Intuitive
I have been learning Xd for about 2 weeks as of 19/02/2021 & so far, this program is one of the most
intuitive pieces of software that I have ever used! I enjoy learning new techniques & pick them up the same day due to the quality of the learning material Adobe & online content creators have provided. I think my proficiency with this software can only increase & I hope this is an appealing prospect!
Please check out my library of Ui Designs from the home page of this site.




Animate: High Understanding
I have a modest understanding of all aspects of this program. However, the only way I tend to utilise this program is when I need to make a frame by frame animation. I don't tend to use motion tweens but I am familiar enough with them that I can use them if needed. I mostly use Adobe Animate for personal passion projects that never see the light of day.


InDesign: Proficient
InDesign is a program I have used to create a few mockup projects, mainly for university. I have created a print ready magazine mockup, which I find is my best work with this software.I can also bring the final product to an interview if that would be of interest to you *wink wink*. Overall, my knowledge of this software is certainly not lacking but I have much to learn when it comes to more complex operations & techniques.


Illustrator: Proficient
Illustrator is one of my lesser used programs, simply because I tend not to use vector graphics. This is all down to personal preference & the style my clients generally expect from my work. That being said, I do understand most of the functions & capabilities of this software. I think the main issue is that I am not very familiar with the hotkeys for it meaning my workflow is often slowed by needing to check what button does what & so on.
Projects & Experience
Over the years I've had the privilege of being involved in some amazing projects
be it through University or connections in my circles, I am extremely proud of what I have done!


Mockup Magazine Prints


This magazine was made entirely by me using InDesign. We were briefed to create a 60+ page magazine spread in 13 weeks, whilst also balancing other studies. This project is a great showcase of my ability to manage my own time, set deadlines for myself & keep my mind focussed for long periods of time. It also shows off some of my skills as a layout designer using InDesign.


The magazine itself is a little dated now & I like to believe that my tastes & preferred styles have changed over the years but I still hold this as one of my greater works. However due to its age, some of the files have been misplaced.


Skills Utilised:
* InDesign proficiency
* Photoshop proficiency
* Gathering feedback from clients, team members & other designers
* Implementing feedback to make meaningful changes to project
* Proper design workflow practice
* Time management skills
* Proper use of design elements
* Small exposure to print process
* Creation of print ready documents


Yagan Square Motion Graphics


These motion graphics were the result of working with clients for Yagan tower. I was briefed to create a pair of minute long motion graphics that would portray an environmental issue. I decided to go down the road of coral bleaching as this topic is one I feel rather strongly about & thought I could create something bright & unique.


This project was made in Photoshop & animated in After Effects & was my first glimpse into the possibilities After Effects had on offer. It also is a great example of how my ideas can change & evolve over time. This piece was shown on Yagan Tower for about an hour & was well received by the public with tourists & locals both taking photos by the tower. The client we worked with was also greatly impressed by the high standard of my work.


Skills Utilised:
* After Effects practice
* Photoshop proficiency
* Working closely with clients & shareholders
* Gathering of and implementation of feedback
* Proper design workflow
* Exposure to having work in a public place
* Optimisation of files for ease of handling
* Creation of video files


Major Project: Slay Soiree


Slay Soiree was a huge endeavour between me & two game devs. We worked on this for 26 weeks straight & are looking at working on it further into the future. Unfortunately, for now I have had to put my work on this project on hold as I am unable to work on a project like that without another source of income & due to the nature of THE VIRUS I am not able to find work.


I made all elements of the visuals of this game from scratch with minimal assistance from some amateur animators. I predominantly used Adobe Animate to... animate & I used Photoshop for all ideation, concepts & single frame illustrations. This created a unique visual style that is rarely seen in games due to the huge amount of time it can take to create something like this.


This project is one of the best team based experiences you can find in my library. Working with these two developers exposed me to how to properly communicate ideas between team members, how to provide feedback & have your own voice in a project as large scale as this. As well as that it showed me that it really is so much easier to work in a team, especially with talented team members like in this project!


Skills Utilised:
* Working in a team based environment
* Photoshop proficiency
* Animate proficiency
* Communicating with team members daily
* Relaying ideas, feedback & progress to team lead
* Sticking to deadlines
* Delivering high quality material
* Creation of easily usable files
* Maintaining & growing relationships within a small team


Feel free to ask any questions about my work, what I'm capable of or What I need to work on for the position. If by some form of miracle I'm not the person you are looking for, I would still greatly appreciate feedback on this website's presentation or function. I'm readily available to work & I eagerly await hearing back from you!
