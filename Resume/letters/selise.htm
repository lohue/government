<p>Thank you for taking the time to inspect my website. I apologise that I did not have a more effective way of informing you about this site however there was no space for a cover letter or any extra information during the application process.

    Hello, My name is Hugh Smith & I am a Graphic Designer with skills in UI/UX looking for work in Perth. I have studied & graduated from a Bachelor of the arts Graphic Design course from September 2018 to December 2020 where I improved my proficiencies with all Adobe suite products & gained hands on experience with Design workflows & situations. I have completed an internship with Monitor WA where I acted as the temporary lead designer. During these few months, I created website mockups & wireframes, brochur spreads & print ready documents. This experience exposed me to working in a team with engineers, web developers & many other roles in a company. I have also been an online Freelance Designer for the past four years. I have worked closely with clients during this time, catering designs to their needs whilst also creaitng the best possible looking designs. I would utilise Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign & more for these projects & over time my proficiencies with all of these programs would reach their heights.
    <br>
    <br>
    This website as a whole is one of my greatest demonstration of my skills. It demonstrates my knowledge of UI design, UX data analysis, HTML & CSS troubleshooting, asset creation & ability to create a cohesive & consistent project.
    <br>
    <br>
    I look forward to hearing back from you soon!
