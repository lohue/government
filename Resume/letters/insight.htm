        <p>Hello! Thanks for making the effort to check out my website, I really appreciate it!<br><br>My name is Hugh Smith. I am a young Graphic Designer & Illustrator looking for a role as a Graphic Designer in Perth & surrounding areas. I am a fresh University graduate having achieved a Bachelor degree in Graphic Design in late 2020. I have been using Adobe products since my early teenage years & built those skills even further in my time at Uni. I am highly proficient in Photoshop & have a great understanding of InDesign & Illustrator. I use these programs daily for personal work, freelance work & hopefully as a professional Graphic Designer in the near future. As well as these programs, I am greatly familiar with the Microsoft Office essentials & have been using them for as long as I can remember! I should also mention my experience with HTML & CSS. My online portfolio you are currently viewing is made entirely from scratch using these languages which I have grown ever more comfortable with. I began learning them in the 3/11/2020 & from there it has been smooth sailing. I hope my website shows off what I have learned well! I greatly enjoy working with others, especially on large scale projects. Interacting with new people is something I always look forward to. I hope we can be in contact soon & I look forward to hearing back from you.</p>
