<p>Hello! Thanks for making the effort to check out my website, I really appreciate it! My name's Hugh Smith & I am a young Graphic Designer/Illustrator with a passion for gritty, authentic design. I have been freelancing since I was in High School (since 2012) & Im looking to take the dive into the digital design industry as soon as possible! I have been using industry standard software all through my studies, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Xd & some smaller open source software's that provide their own purpose in my work. During my studies, I have learned a lot about the design workflow & Im not stranger to following style guides to a perfect degree. I also worked in teams with other students & learned that I have a strong passion for large scale team projects which was one of the major reasons I am seeking work in Design! I am a fun, determined & hard working individual who is not afraid to put in the time to learn something new or build upon my already strong skills. I hope this is something that interests you & I look forward to hearing back from you!
