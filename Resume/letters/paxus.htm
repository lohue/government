<p>My name is Hugh Smith & I'm a Graphic Designer & illustrator with experience as a UI Designer. I live in East Perth & would love to work for your company! I graduated with a Bachelor of the Arts Graphic Design course in late 2020 where I learned advanced techniques with most Adobe products. I also worked closely with professional designers in California where I was mentored on proper use of UI design software & how to improve a designers workflow. I have completed an internship with Monitor WA as a temporary Lead Designer where I developed rough drafts & showed them to peers in the office as well as clients that would be working closely with them. I have a keen eye for responsiveness & can easily provide feedback & help design more effective layouts with my knowledge of design principals. I keep myself updated with modern design techniques & software. I am very familiar with wireframing tools & Illustrator.

I look forward to hearing back from you & hope you are impressed by my portfolio.
