<p>Hello! Thanks for making the extra effort to view my online site, I really appreciate it.<br><br>
     My name is Hugh Smith. I am a young Graphic Designer & Illustrator looking for a role as a Graphic Designer in Perth &
surrounding areas. I am a fresh University graduate having achieved a Bachelor degree in Graphic Design in late 2020. I
have been using Adobe products since my early teenage years & built those skills even further in my time at Uni. I am highly
proficient in Photoshop & have a great understanding of InDesign & Illustrator. I use these programs daily for personal work,
freelance work & hopefully as a professional Graphic Designer in the near future. I am very familiar with having to manage
my time in a busy environment & I also greatly enjoy working with others, especially on large scale projects. I may be lacking the experience in the industry
 but I promise you, I make up for it with eagerness, determination & spirit! I urge you read
my full resume on my site for more detale, I mean, detail! I hope we can be in contact soon & I look forward to hearing back
from you.
</p>
