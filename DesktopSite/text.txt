My name is Lohue.

Im an aspiring Designer, Illustrator & Web Developer who has 
been attempting to remake my entire brand, business and self. 
I have been working creatively for as long as I can remember
sometimes professionally and sometimes personally. Some of my
more noticable achievements include having my original work 
displayed on the Yagan Square tower in Perth, Western Australia
& working for 5 years as a commission artist online with relative
success. Unfortunately, I had to stop this business temporarily 
as I had to commit to my studies as a Graphic Designer. That being 
said, I am nearing the end of my studies & I'm hoping to make a 
name for myself both as an Illustrator and as a Designer online.

If you have taken interest in any of my work I will be making an
option for users of this site to sign up for a Patreon-like
service. By signing up for this service, you will recieve all of 
my past work, future work and potentially be able to recieve extra
work that I dont post to the public. I dont want to promise too
much, but I may also do requests for people who have signed up.
This service will come at a small cost ($1-$10) depending on how
much you would want out of this service. For now, however, I will be
posting my art here and on other social media platforms.
Thank you so much for taking the tme to look at my site.
